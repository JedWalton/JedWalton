The enlightening, immersive, challenging and ultimately deeply satisfying experience of my Bachelor of Science with Honours in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence inspires a persistent desire and effort to continually improve, provide value and solve increasingly challenging problems.

With meticulous intent and fervour, I strive to deepen proficiency in programming and problem-solving. To maximise the benefits, I utilize organisational software to assist in dissecting macro goals into individual tasks to schedule in my central calendar to ruthlessly execute and document progress. It is this systematic approach that optimizes for time and focus, maximizing adherence to achieve well-documented and quantifiable progress towards concrete objectives.

Consistent, deliberate practice enables the development of increasingly deep understanding of Java and other programming languages, algorithms, technologies, paradigms, concepts, tools and rigorous software engineering best practices. 

It is both my mission and intent to converge on and hone the ability to produce at an elite level in terms of both Quality and Speed.
