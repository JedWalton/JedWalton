The enlightening, immersive, challenging and ultimately deeply satisfying experience of my Bachelor of Science with Honours in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence inspires a persistent desire and effort to continually improve, provide value and solve increasingly challenging problems.

Upon graduation, with meticulous intent and fervour, I crafted a personal curriculum to deepen proficiency in programming and problem-solving. To maximise the benefits, I utilize organisational software to assist in dissecting macro goals into individual tasks to schedule in my central calendar to ruthlessly execute and document progress. It is this systematic approach that optimizes for time and focus, maximizing adherence to achieve well-documented and quantifiable progress towards concrete objectives.

This has proven extremely beneficial in compounding skills over time in computer science, programming and problem-solving. It is this thorough, consistent and deliberate practice that enables me to efficiently develop aptitude and drive reliable value creation in a growing number of domains.

Exemplifying this, during my dissertation at the University Of Sussex, I designed and wrote a Ray Traced Reverberation Chamber in C++ from scratch. This is notable due to my limited experience of C++ upon embarking on this problem. After a careful consideration of potential technological solutions, both my academic supervisor, and I decisively concluded C++ to be the most appropriate tool for the task at hand. Despite my limited experience of C++ at the time, through deep,efficient, diligent work, I quickly developed the skill and achieved a first class result on the project.

 Further evidence of ability can be found at my GitHub at GitHub.com/JedWalton. I continue this consistent, deliberate practice to develop increasingly deep understanding of Java and other programming languages, algorithms, technologies, paradigms, concepts, tools and rigorous software engineering best practices. It is both my mission and intent to continuously hone the ability to produce in terms of both Quality and Speed.
