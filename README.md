The enlightening, immersive, challenging and ultimately deeply satisfying experience of my Honours Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence inspires a persistent desire and effort to continually improve, provide value and solve increasingly challenging problems.

I strive to produce at an elite level in terms of both Quality and Speed and thus, with fervour and meticulous intent, I follow a consistent, deliberate practice to enable increasingly deep understanding of programming languages, algorithms, technologies, paradigms, concepts, tools and rigorous software engineering practices.

To maximise the benefits of the practice, I utilize organisational software to assist in dissecting macro goals into individual tasks to schedule in my central calendar to ruthlessly execute logging the progress. It is this systematic approach that optimizes for time and focus, maximizing adherence to achieve well-defined, documented and quantifiable objectives.
