The enlightening, immersive, challenging and ultimately deeply satisfying experience of my Honours Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence inspires a persistent desire and effort to continually improve, provide value and solve increasingly challenging problems.

With fervour and meticulous intent, I strive to deepen proficiency in computer science, programming and problem-solving. To maximise the benefits, I utilize organisational software to assist in dissecting macro goals into individual tasks to schedule in my central calendar to ruthlessly execute and document progress. It is this systematic approach that optimizes for time and focus, maximizing adherence to achieve well-defined, documented and quantifiable objectives.

Consistent, deliberate practice enables the development of increasingly deep understanding of programming languages, algorithms, technologies, paradigms, concepts, tools and rigorous software engineering best practices. 

I strive to produce at an elite level in terms of both Quality and Speed.
